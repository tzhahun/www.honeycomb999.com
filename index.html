<p>.</p>


<p>Our company devises and develops technology and equipment for the production of comb honey. Our latest design is a section (mini-frame) made from the wood of deciduous trees, making it completely ecologically clean.
The aim of our company is to supply bee-keepers with everything they need to produce comb honey of the highest quality.
We have begun the manufacture of serial sections and can offer them as parts or fully assembled. This allows the large scale production of honey in combs without unnecessary additional amounts of equipment or effort. Our company can also supply final card/cardboard packaging for comb honey.
For honey production in combs using section frames we offer two versions.

</p>
<p>
  <h4>Version 1</h4>
This method is most suitable for the production of honey on small farms or by those who keep bees as a hobby. This method has proven itself in practice to be more effective, because the process enables the frames to be transferred from the edges to the centre and vice versa. This encourages the building of the combs and accordingly reduces the time needed for the comb honey to be produced.

<p>
 <h5> The stages:</h5> 
1 Establishing the foundation in the sections: <br>
2 ways: <br>
Small strips of comb foundation to encourage construction:
It has been established through experience that strips of comb foundation on the top are not enough, as in nearly 70% of the sections the bees do not manage to build completely to the bottom of the section, and gaps are left underneath the honeycomb. We recommend that two strips are installed.
A continuous strip of comb foundation: <br>
This method is more effective, as it reduces the time to finish building the combs and improves the quality of the combs. But in this case you must be sure that the comb foundation is of completely organic origin.
2 Installation of sections in a standard frame
3 Put into the housing
</p>
<p>
<h4>Version 2</h4>
This method is best suited for the mass production of comb honey, where technology of keeping bees in housing systems is used. This method does not require standard frames and additional expenditure on them, which allows production costs to be lowered.
<h5>The stages:</h5> 
1 Establishing the foundation in the sections <br>
2 Installing the supporting grid into the body <br>
3 Installing the sections into the store housing <br>
It is very important to mention that using the technology for producing comb honey does not require equipment for pumping honey, and also significantly reduces the effort required to extract it. Honey in combs is guaranteed to be of high quality and have a long shelf life.
